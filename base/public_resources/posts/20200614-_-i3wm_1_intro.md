# [i3] 1. Overview

## Intro

I have been always trying to find the perfect WM for Linux that is light-weight, highly configurable while satisfy all I need. KDE is an excellent candidate that I have been using for years, but the performance can struggle when I use my ThinkPad X250 ThinkPad with three external monitors (Presumably the integrated graphics cannot keep up with the number of pixels of three monitors). I have finally settled with [i3](https://i3wm.org/) for my Arch Linux setup.

While i3wm has a small memory footprint and offers a pleasant user experience, there are a lot of tweaking that needed to be done before it met my expectation.

I will write about my setup with i3 configuration journey in a few posts.

## Tech Stack

I am using the following softwares for my setup:

1. [i3](https://i3wm.org/) as tiling-based window manager
2. [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) as the status bar
3. [picom(fork of compton)](https://github.com/yshui/picom) as composer
4. [nitrogen](https://github.com/l3ib/nitrogen/) to manage wallpaper
5. [dunst](https://dunst-project.org/) to handle and display notifications

6. [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) as window switcher
