### About the creation of this Blogger

Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself. --George Bernard Shaw

Today is June 14, 2020. For almost ten years, I have been thinking about what I will be doing when I am no longer a student. Who I wanted to become. There are countless examples of what people have done and achieved. But life doesn't have a recipe that I can follow -- Everyone's life is unique. The past experiences people shared are usually heavily based on the environment at their time, which will not necessarily apply to our time.

When I was younger, I knew what I needed to do, what I needed to learn. Everyone around me was doing the same thing and shared a common objective. But as I grow, the decisions I made started to come with compromises.

I used to be upset about not being able to make the right decision, worrying about gaining nothing after all the efforts I have given. However, when I looked back to the past after everything settled, I found that each piece of these experiences is essential to who I am today. I was not finding who I would be; I was creating who I would be. All of those experiences are worthy of remembrance.

I decided to create this blog to start recording little things about work, life, and study that I find interesting, along with some thoughts I have regarding anything. This website will serve as a place to recollect old memories that would have lost in time.
