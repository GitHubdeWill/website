# Hello world!

Today I received my diploma for my Master's Degree @ UMass Amherst. This marks the end of my life as a student. After all these years, I finally have time to work on what I have wanted to do for a long time -- a personal blogger!

I spent the last three days to rebuild my website from scratch. The source code is hosted on https://github.com/GitHubdeWill/website

I will be joining Amazon Robotics in a week. Hope everything goes well.
